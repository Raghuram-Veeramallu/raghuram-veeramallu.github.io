**Welcome to My World of Data and Discovery!**  

**🚀 Meet Hari - Your Data Science Maverick!**

Hello there! I'm Hari, currently navigating the fascinating realm of Data Science as a Master's student at the prestigious [College of Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/). But that's just the tip of the iceberg!

**🌟 Big Data and Deep Learning: My Passion**

But what really makes my heart race? The exhilarating fields of Big Data and Deep Learning, especially their applications in autonomous vehicles. It's not just about the data; it's about how we can use it to propel us into a future where technology and humanity converge.

**🎓 A Solid Foundation in Computer Science and Mathematics**

My journey began at [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home), India, where I delved deep into Computer Science and Engineering, enhanced with a supplementary minor in Mathematics. This blend of disciplines wasn't just an academic pursuit; it was a launchpad for my passion in data science.

**💼 From Predictive Models to Amazon's Tech Innovations**

Post-graduation, I joined [Josh Technology Group](https://www.joshtechnologygroup.com/) as a Data Scientist. Picture this: I developed predictive models for [CalyxPod](https://www.pod.ai/), slashing recruitment costs by a whopping 50%! My days involved designing warehouse schemas, crafting ETL pipelines, and fine-tuning SQL scripts and OLAP techniques, ultimately reducing report latency by 80%.

Subsequently, I joined Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. There, I was instrumental in developing and implementing [BuyWithPrime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/), a service that extends the convenience, fast shipping, and trusted checkout experience of Amazon Prime to various online retailers. This role not only involved enhancing the shopping experience for Prime members on external websites but also empowering merchants with Amazon's fulfillment network, thereby driving customer satisfaction and business growth.

<!-- As a Software Development Engineer, I was at the forefront of [BuyWithPrime](https://buywithprime.amazon.com/), Amazon's one-click solution , architecting the core returns lifecycle for D2C orders. My role was a blend of innovation and collaboration, contributing to the groundbreaking BwP LFBF (Label-Free Box-Free) returns architecture. -->

***Join me on this journey of exploration, innovation, and transformation. Let's redefine what's possible with data!***
